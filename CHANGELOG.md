# templati changelog


## 1.0.3 (unreleased)

* Add meta-tag viewport to head-tag of a Doc.

* If a parent tag already contains text, create a wrapper-tag
  around the text before adding a new child tag, so you can
  address the text as an own element specifically in frontend.

* Change hidden field 'form' to `_formname`, so it won't be
  accidentally overriden.

## 1.0.2 (2021-06-08)

* Add class Form.
